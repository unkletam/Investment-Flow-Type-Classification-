### Aim
This project aims to Analyze and Predict Investment Flow Type using a Machine Learning. Currently, For my model, Iâ€™ve used KNN. As for the dataset, This dataset geolocates Chinese Government-financed projects that were implemented between 2000-2014. It captures 3,485 projects worth $273.6 billion in total official financing. The dataset includes both Chinese aid and non-concessional official financing.
