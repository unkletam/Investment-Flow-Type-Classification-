The Morupule B Power Station expansion project will be carried out by the China National Electric Equipment Corporation. African Development Bank and World Bank funding is required to close the financing gap of the project.

Contract details reveal 35 per cent of the total investment would be paid in cash by the Nigerian side within a month, with the remaining 65 per cent taking the form of loans. The loan stipulates $114.9 million for the project's 335MW power plant, signed in 2002, at 6% interest, a grace period of 6 years, maturity in 12 years.The total cost of the project was $359.71 million, with a Chinese commitment of $297.75 million funded by the Export-Import Bank of China. Additional funding may have come from the Nigeria Power and Steel Department. The plant was put into operation in 2007. Nigerian former president Obasanjo stated in 2007 that Papalanto, as well as Chinese-financed Omotosho, were generating power for Nigeria's electricity grid in May 2007.

183,"As per Brautigam's article and other sources: In 2007 China agreed to finance the 400 MW Bui Dam, on the Black Volta river at the southern end of Bui National Park in Ghana. The dam was financed by two separately negotiated China Exim bank loans. One was a commercial export buyers_„Ž credit of US$292 million with 12 years_„Ž maturity, a grace period of five years and an interest rate set at a margin of 1.075 per cent over the prevailing Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRR). The other, with a fixed interest rate of 2 per cent, appeared to be either a concessional loan or a preferential export credit, for about US$270 million. Development Assistance Committee rules recommend that a mixed credit like this be reported separately: _„ƒone for the _„ñsoft_„ loan [ODA] and one for the commercial loan [OOF]. _„ƒTied aid_„Ž like this is allowed under OECD rules for projects that cannot attract commercial financing, although OECD members would be required to report the offer and its terms so that other OECD members could compete on the same terms if they were so inclined (Brautigam 2010). Just like some of China Eximbank_„Žs larger credits in countries such as Angola, the Bui Dam project finance was a resource-secured loan. In this case, it was guaranteed not through oil or minerals, but through export sales of cocoa beans. Genertec Corporation of China has a cocoa sales agreement with the Ghana Cocoa Board for up to 40 000 Mt of cocoa beans (30‘_000 main crop; 10 000 light crop) annually over the life of the loan_„îthat is, 20 years. By September of 2009, EXIM Bank had disbursed 41.73 US million dollars to Ghana for the project. China Eximbank also required Bui Hydropower to have a power purchase agreement with the Electricity Company of Ghana. The net revenue from this will be deposited into an escrow account to help repay the loan. The price for the future electricity was tentatively negotiated to be in a range between US$0.035 and US$0.055 cents kW/h (Habia 2009). The first power generating unit of 133 megawatts from the Bui hydroelectric project became operational on May 3, 2013, with plans for all 400 megawatts to come online by end of 2013. Two additional loans were made by China in 2012 for this project (ID# 30086). Sinohydro was contractor, and reports the contract total as US $596 million on its website. On May 3, 2013 President John Dramani Mahama, accompanied by a number of central and local government officials, and the Chinese Ambassador to Ghana, attended an inauguration ceremony for the dam's first turbine, with construction of the remain 3 turbines expected by the end of the year. UPDATE: The third and final generating unit of the Bui Hydroelectric Project was commissioned in December of 2013. Meanwhile, other associated and non-power works on the Project including Bui City will continue until the second quarter of 2014, when the project will be fully completed.","http://www.pennenergy.com/index/articles/pe-article-tools-template.articles.hrhrw.News.Ghanas_cocoa_to_help_pay_China_for_building_400-MW_Bui.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070903e393000wv&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.sinohydro.com/664-2227-438511.aspx, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.docstoc.com/docs/76483699/Mou-for-Project-Loan, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020080926e49q00039&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://ghananewsagency.org/economics/phase-two-of-bui-hydro-project-takes-off-5204, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-188009334/ghana-china-sign-seven.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-188451344/ghana-china-approves-562m.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DJI0000020070420e34k00021&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.chinapower.com.cn/newsarticle/1105/new1105544.asp, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.american.edu/sis/faculty/upload/Brautigam-Chinese-Aid-in-Africa.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.mofep.gov.gh/sites/default/files/budget/Budget_2010.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2013-05/04/c_132358435_2.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://eng.sinohydro.com/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=show&catid=42&id=127, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.mofep.gov.gh/sites/default/files/news/2011_Annual_Progress_Report.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=274883, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.iprcc.org.cn/userfiles/file/Deborah%20Brautigam-EN-Paper(1).pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://allafrica.com/stories/201312210004.html?viewall=1, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-07/10/c_133474011.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2014/08/08/chinese-dams-in-africa/?, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; http://collection.europarchive.org/tna/20080305120132/http:/dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/china-dev-africa.pdf, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); http://collection.europarchive.org/tna/20080305120132/http:/dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/china-dev-africa.pdf, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/countries/east-africa/ethiopia/, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.mofep.gov.gh/sites/default/files/budget/2008_Budget.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/55140#files-area, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/15230/1/Interaction_of_Chinese_Institutions.pdf, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation)","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070903e393000wv&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020080926e49q00039&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DJI0000020070420e34k00021&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks"
195,"Description: In 2002, a project for the modernization of Nigeria_„Žs railway system was proposed, which China offered to finance with a 1 billion USD soft loan from the China Exim Bank. On October 30, 2006, the Chinese Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) and the Ministry of Transportation of Nigeria signed a contract worth 8.3 billion USD for the implementation of the Lagos-Kano Railway Modernization Project and was linked with the 2006 China-Nigeria 'Oil for Infrastructure agreement' (ID#1844). The price of the project was reduced to 8 billion USD in 2009. In September 2012, Nigeria finalized a 600 million USD loan agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China to partially fund the rail line. 500 million USD will go to the rail project, while the remaining 100 million USD will finance ICT infrastructure. The loan will be repaid at 2.5 percent interest over twenty years. The grace period on the loan is seven years. In order to release funding pressures, the project was planned to be implemented in phases. The first phase of the project includes modernizing the 186.5 km Abuja to Kaduna section of the 1,313 km railway from Lagos to Kano. The cost of the first phase is projected to be 849,750,903 USD and will be constructed over 36 months. The second phase of the project is the Lagos-Ibadan section of the railway, a double track line with a total length of 156.8km and a projected speed of 150km per hour for both passengers and freight transportation. This portion is worth approximately 1.487 billion USD with a construction period of 36 months. In July 2013, the Minister of Transportation reported that 65% of the work on the Abuja-Kaduna line had been completed, while the contract for Lagos-Ibadan double track had been signed but was pending the completion of an agreement with the China Exim bank. PPIAF-ID:206 However, Deborah Brautigam reported in December 2010 that after CCECC won the $8.3 billion contract, the Chinese government had offered a line of export credit for 2 billion USD at a competitive commercial rate, as well as a preferential export credit of 500 million USD. The 2 billion USD in export credits were considered for projects other than the railway but were never used and expired. The 500 million USD preferential credit was renewed and might be used to fund a part of the railway infrastructure project. The flow type is unknown due to contradictory sources, with Brautigam referring to the commitment as an export credit and the Nigerian government referring to it as a concessional loan. As of July 2013 this project is anywhere from 27-68% completed (different sources quote different numbers), though the source of future funding is still unclear. As of July 23, 2013 the foundation stone for the building of Lots 1A and 3 stations was laid.","http://english.crcc.cn/Portals/4/LTN20120831811.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=afnws00020020702dy72003uz&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.chinaafricarealstory.com/2010/08/real-cost-of-chinese-railway.html, Social Media, including Unofficial Blogs; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020090425e54p0008g&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020091029e5as0000g&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=TMRTNL0020071212e3cd0000m&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=NRG0000020061105e2b50005l&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.miit.gov.cn/n11293472/n11293832/n11379123/n11527639/12747766.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.chinaafricarealstory.com/2010/12/moises-naim-and-9-billion-dollar-myth.html, Social Media, including Unofficial Blogs; http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=721518, Social Media, including Unofficial Blogs; http://www.google.co.za/#output=search&sclient=psy-ab&q=4+billion+China+Nigeria+Infrastructure+oil+2006&oq=4+billion+China+Nigeria+Infrastructure+oil+2006&gs_l=hp.3...336624.405497.0.405672.63.53.7.0.0.0.295.4538.31j13j3.47.0...0.0...1c.1.18.psy-ab.BB9ZQNdErQM&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm=bv.48572450,d.dmQ&fp=18c4154a0af92d76&biw=1185&bih=726, Academic Journal Article; http://allafrica.com/stories/201207190156.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/06/new-railway-lines-to-be-executed-says-minister/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.nigeria.gov.ng/2012-10-29-11-09-25/news/437-vp-sambo-lays-track-for-abuja-kaduna-fast-train, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://fmi.gov.ng/minister-endorses-1-4-billion-lagos-ibadan-rail-project/, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020130703e973000yq&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=XNEWS00020130723e97n007hh&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020130327e93r000gc&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=XNEWS00020130704e974008c1&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/40f9771c-fd06-11e1-a4f2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3GJj4n2ug, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/fg-china-exim-bank-seal-600m-deal-on-abuja-light-rail-galaxy-backbone/124857/, Media Report, including Wikileaks","http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=afnws00020020702dy72003uz&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020090425e54p0008g&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020091029e5as0000g&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=TMRTNL0020071212e3cd0000m&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=NRG0000020061105e2b50005l&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020130703e973000yq&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=XNEWS00020130723e97n007hh&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AFNWS00020130327e93r000gc&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=XNEWS00020130704e974008c1&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks"

Additionally, delays were caused in 2009 when a fire broke out in one of the generators. In February 2013, it was reported the lengthy improvements at the Kariba North station had come to an end.

810,"On November 7, 2006, Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki and China Development Bank governor Mr. Chen Yuan met and agreed to sign a framework between the bank and the government of Kenya to expedite the funding of a project for low and medium income housing. The project came in response to Kenya's substantial housing deficit. On December 6, 2006, China Development Bank announced that it would provide a 17 million dollar commercial loan for the housing project, to be repaid in 15 years. The Development Bank of Kenya plans to provide long-term finance of up to 15 years to low and middle income housing project customers. On May 30, 2008 the ground-breaking ceremony of the housing project occurred. The entire project is expected to last about fifteen years (until 2021) or later, but may last longer due to slow progress accredited to court injuctions and land scarcity. As of 2012, only 2,000 housing units have been completed comared to the 40,000 planned for completion.Implementation of the project's first phase involves the production of 720 housing units for sale and appears to have been successfully completed. As of January 2011, the implementing agencies have concentrated their efforts on Phases 2 and 3. The implementation of the project has so far been carried out by implementing agencies China Wu Yi Corporation Limited and Ederman Properties. Construction efforts in the 'Greatwall Apartments' Complex have successfully provided Kenyan citizens with 528 apartments, as well as facilities including shops and school. Another 105 houses have been constructed as part of the Kileleshwa Park Apartments. Further construction efforts include building 700 housing units in Ngara. 1,000 units in Kibera, 700 units in Madaraka and Nairobi West and 105 units in Lang'ata. The project is linked to the Development Financial Cooperation Framework Agreement (DFCFA) signed by the Kenyan government and the China Development Bank in December 2008. As per the DFCFA, the project will operate in accordance with market principles rather than traditional aid.Funding for the package came as part of a 20 million USD credit for housing, education and health care from the China Development Bank.Contacts who have publicly commented on the project include Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Zhang Ming, general director of the Africa Project Development Team Zhu Qingdong, managing director of the Erdemann Property Limited Yang Zeyun and Housing minister Soita Shitanda. The project may be linked to further low-cost housing projects according to senior comissioner Zhu Qingdong. Qingdong states that the China Development Bank plans to work with the Government of Kenya, Kenya Development Bank, and other financial institutions to support these additional low-cost housing projects.

980,"On June 27, 2009, the Director-General of Ethiopian Roads Authority (ERA) Zaid Woldegebriel and the Chinese Communication and Construction Company (CCCC) manager signed a deal to construct a new eight-lane asphalt expressway stretching 80 km from Addis Ababa to Adama, Ethiopia's first expressway. It will reduce the transportation time on Ethiopia's main import-export route from three hours to one hour. The project, an estimated total cost of $612 million, will be financed by a $350 million Export-Import Bank of China loan, and the Ethiopian government covering the balance. Construction began in April 2010. Terms of the loan are uncertain, but Deborah Brautigam reports tolls will help repay the loan over 20 years. According to Samson Wondimu, Communication Director of ERA, construction was more than 30% complete in April 2012. This project has provided the groundwork for the use of innovative technology via tolls and creates local employment opportunities. It is also expected to contribute to the development of roadways between capital and regional locations, such as Hawassa and Bale. Construction was expected to be completed in early 2014. An additional loan from the EXIM Bank for the expressway and two feeder roads worth USD 320M was committed in late 2013 (project ID #30886).","http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-211549924/ethiopia-china-sign-349m.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.2merkato.com/201204271164/ethiopian-expressway-336-complete, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.itsethiopia.org/2012-02-13-13-31-55/highways.html, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-38242126_ITM, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.diretube.com/articles/read-ethiopia-addis-ababa-adama-expressway-construction-well-in-progress_1489.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://books.google.com/books?id=nDSR1FF2hY8C&dq=zinder+water+project,+niger,+china,+2002&source=gbs_navlinks_s, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/i/jyjl/k/201204/20120408095284.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp01185.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp01185.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Generic-Documents/Media_Embargoed_Content/EN-AEO_2011_embargo%206%20Juin.pdf, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); http://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/news/news69404.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks",

1112,"On April 26, 2007, Jia Qinglin met with Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki to celebrate the decision to invest in multiple road projects. The project includes a 26km road connecting to the airport, which was originally funded by an aid package signed in 2006. The project also includes three other bypass roads (Southern, Northern, and Eastern), which will involve widening of roads, addition of pedestrian walkways and streetlights, and the removal of roundabouts. The funding is coming from a concessional loan from ExIm Bank, which will cover 85% of the projected 740 million CNY costs. 85% of 740 million CNY is the listed amount, 629 million CNY. The implementing force of the construction is the China Road and Bridge Company (CRBC). The Eastern bypass was opened in March of 2011 and transferred over to the Kenyan government in July of 2012. The Northern bypass road was also completed. Between these two bypass roads, $13.7 billion KES was spent. The Southern bypass is still under construction. The airport road has also been reconstructed.

1851,"Description: On March 16, 2006, Nigerian Minister of Commerce and Ambassador Idris Waziri and China's Guangdong Xinguang International Group signed a memorandum of understanding for the construction of a fast rail system from Lagos to Abuja, a light rail from Murala Mohammed International Airport to Lagos, and Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport to the Abuja City center. Guangdong Xinguang International Group planned to invest in three stages of the project, and $2 billion was made available by the Nigerian government to commence the projects. The Export-Import Bank of China funded $1 billion for this project and another rail project from Lagos to Kano (ID#195). But the project, initially scheduled for completion in 2013, became financially troubled. A loan was signed to secure financing in September of 2012 with terms of 500 million USD at 2.5 percent for over 20 years maturity and 7 year grace period, financed by China's Export-Import Bank. Though the World Bank's Building Bridges reported that Guangdong Xinguang International Group would be working on the project, it now appears that China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation is implementing the project. The network includes two lines: one links Abuja with Nyanya, Kubwa, Maraba and Lugbe; and one connecting Kubwa to Nnmadi Azikiwe International Airport; these lines have the intention to benefit the lower social classes of Nigeria as a faster commuting method. According to a Deborah Brautigam China in Africa; The Real Story blog post from September 2012, CCECC had already completed 25% percent of the light rail network at the time of new term agreements in September 2012.

The total cost was $1 billion USD, and China promised to provide 85%of the cost. The project was scheduled to be completed by 2012. However, Sunrise Power and Transmission Ltd, a bidder shortlisted on bidding for the project, initiated legal action against the Federal government in 2007, which stalled the project.

In 2012, the project capacity increased to 3,050 MW, and President Jonathan said the project design was complete. According to a 2012 article, EXIM Bank of China promised 75 per cent of the project cost, with counterpart funding in the sum of $309 million from the Nigerian government.

Sinohydro will build the power plant at its expense and operate it for nine years before transferring ownership to the Nigerian government. As of December 2013, high level intrigues involving powerful interests in the Presidency have caused delays in the execution of this project. Prior to this it was expected for this project to be completed in early 2018, although now it is unclear when this project will be completed.

2004,"In 2010, the Ghanaian Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning secured preferential buyer's credit worth $260 million USD for the execution of the Kpong Water Expansion Supply Project to help boost water delivery systems in the country. The facility has a grace period of five years, repayment duration of 15 years, maturity period of 20 years, interest rate of 2 percent per annum, a commitment fee of 0.75 percent per annum, a management fee of 1 percent flat, and a grant element of 37.08 percent. The total project cost is $273 million, with the remaining $13 million USD provided by the Ghanaian government. The project when completed, would increase water supply from Kpong Head Works to Accra and Tema to improve the reliability of potable water delivery to domestic, commercial and industrial customers. The project is expected to be completed in 2014. As of July 2012, the project was 30 percent complete. The Kpong Water Supply Extension Project covers a planning calendar that extends to 2015 and includes enhancement of transmission lines to increase water supply by an additional 40 million gallons a day. Checks by the Daily Graphic from the Ghana Water Company [GWCL] indicated that work had already begun on the assessment, which should be taken between three and six months to complete. The construction of a new intake and water pumping station for bulk water supply from Kpong with capacity of 196,000 cubic metres per day will form the first phase, with the second phase covering the construction of a new treatment plant of 186,000 cubic metres or 41 million gallons a day. The third phase consists of a new treated water pumping station as well as a pressure transmission (mains) system from Kpong to Accra through Oyibi to terminate at Okponglo [suburb of Accra] out in the five-year plan.

18800,"On September 14, 2006, the governments of Zimbabwe and China signed a US$200 million loan agreement to be used for agricultural support and the planned importation of 387,000 tons of Chinese fertilizer for needy Zimbabwean farmers. Agricultural uses for the US$200 million loan include the payment of agricultural equipment, chemicals, and other critical requirements. The shipment of fertilizer is expected to arrive in Zimbabwe at the beginning of October 2006 to help farmers deal with crop shortages. The loan is being facilitated by both the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and the Export-Import Bank of China. The Zimbabwean government was represented by Gideon Gono, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, while the fertilizer agreement is a result of a visit to China made by the Vice President of Zimbabwe, Joice Mujuru, and the Zimbabwe Secretary of Economic Development, A. Bvumbe.The first consignment of fertilizer from China arrived into Zimbabwe by December 26, 2012, although the amount of fertilizer was not specified. The fertilizer in question was of Compound Types D, S, C, and L. On February 1, 2007, Samuel Muvuti, acting chief executive of the state-owned Zimbabwe Grain Marketing Board, announced that a second shipment of 13,000 tonnes of fertilizer procured through the US$200 million loan was delivered to Zimbabwe via Mozambique from China with 8,000 tonnes still in transit and 14,000 tonnes awaiting transportation at port in Mozambique with the goal of delivering the fertilizer from the port by mid-February 2007. As of this date, only 57,000 tonnes of the agreed 387,000 had arrived in the country.In 2006, the government of Zimbabwe agreed to mortgage the loan from China using platinum mining concessions from the Selous and Northfields Mines. The mining transactions were to occur through the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) and Chinese mining firm Wanbao Mining. However, in a different US$200 million deal with Eximbank, also in 2006, these same mining areas were also up for collateral, causing both deals to stall. On July 11, 2009, Minister Biti signed another memorandum of understanding with the Chinese company Wanbao to free up the mining concessions in Selous and Northfields and allow Wanbao to being mining after the clarification and finalization of legal documentation between the Chinese and the Zimbabwean governments. The terms of the agreement include: the value of the commercial contract should be more than US$2 million.The portion of the Chinese content of exported goods should be no less than 50% of the total value. The cash payment (down payment) made by the importer to the Chinese exporter should not be less than 15% of the total contract value or 20% in the case of ship export contract. The export buyer's credit provided by the Eximbank of China for an export project of goods or services shall not exceed 85% of the total contract value, and 80% in the case of a ship export contract. Additional research into the completion date of the fertilizer delivery was unsuccessful. In 2007, a consignment of 1,000 more tractors and an assortment of other related farming implements worth $100 million USD from China was expected to arrive. The implements include harvesters, irrigation pumps, disc harrows, planters, and electricity generators. As of November of 2011, the facilities were being shipped from China to Zimbabwe. These goods compose the remaining value of the $200 million USD Chinese government loan. It appears that Zimbabwe purchased 97 trucks under the deal, but no financial value for the project was given. However, as of July 2012, it does appear that Zimbabwe defaulted on its repayment of the $200 million USD loan. China has extended the repayment period for the buyer's credit loan from five years to eight years.

Beijing Construction Engineering Group was responsible for implementing the construction of the passenger terminal, which began in 2011 with the construction expected to last 18 months. Work was brought to a halt in 2012 so that it could be inspected by ADPI, a French engineering and architectural firm. Based on ADPI's recommendations, the Zanzibar government chose to remodel the construction at a cost of 115 million USD. This came with criticism of the work done by Beijing Construction Engineering Group. Zanzibar's government secured a 30-year preferential loan of 73.85 million USD for the work (#33736). It is also reported that the World Bank is now providing funding for the project. The whole project was previously estimated to cost 70.4 million USD. The commitment date for this project is unknown.

The funding status of this project as a loan or grant is unclear.","http://www.iprcc.org/userfiles/file/Li%20Jiali-EN.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://jjhzj.mofcom.gov.cn/article/y/201104/20110407510419.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://jjhzj.mofcom.gov.cn/article/y/200904/20090406162169.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ccs.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rex_PhanW_Report_Final_Rex_2014.pdf, Academic Journal Article; http://books.google.com/books?id=OyUVbekUB_oC&pg=PA241&lpg=PA241&dq=million+benin+agricultural+demonstration+center+china&source=bl&ots=AeeTEugRgM&sig=WOkvrOFJnP-7sPe3jVhvdQQ9iUU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zaZAVN3xJMvuoAStsIGgCA&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=million%20benin%20agricultural%20demonstration%20center%20china&f=false, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2014-07/11/content_17729005.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WL0904/S02310/cablegate-benin-chinese-finance-construction-of-pilot-agricultural.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks",
31777,"On May 11, 2014, Kenyan and Chinese leaders formally signed agreements for the construction of a 3.8 billion USD portion of a railway to run from the Kenyan port of Mombasa to Nairobi and then on to neighboring states. It is to run from Mombasa to Nairobi and will extend eventually to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan. China was to finance 90% of the first stage which costs $3.8bn (‘£2.3bn), with Kenya putting up the remaining 10%. However, a working paper from China Africa Research Institute reported that China provided 85% of the total project financing with Kenya providing the remaining funds. China Exim Bank provided $1.6 billion concessional loan and a commercial loan of $1.633 billion for a total of $3.233 billion. The $1.6 billion concessional loan is good for 20 years at a 2% interest rate and a payment period of 13 years with a 7 year grace period (project #31777). The $1.633 billion preferential concessional loan has a 'interest rate of six months' (assumed typo in source), valid for 15 years with a payment period of 10 and grace period of 5 (see Project ID #37103). The project will be built by the China Road & Bridge Corporation (CRBC), with Kenya Railway Corporation (KR) supervising.The 609-kilometer Nairobi to Mombasa portion of the railway was expected to start construction Oct 1, and the entire line is expected to be completed March 2018. According to KR, the railway will connect Mombasa to Malaba (with a branch line to Kisumu) onward to Kampala, Kigali (with branch line to Kasese) and Juba (with a branch line to Pakwach).","http://news.163.com/14/0511/09/9RV3MSLA00014JB5.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-china-east-african-leaders-sign-up-for-new-rail-link-/1912197.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://allafrica.com/stories/201409081898.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2000133939/construction-of-standard-gauge-railway-to-start-next-month, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.coastweek.com/3732-latest-news-Mombasa-Nairobi-rail-project-by-Chinese-focus-on-staff-localization.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://krc.co.ke/?p=732, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://ke.china-embassy.org/chn/xw/t1188228.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://ke.china-embassy.org/chn/xw/t1231221.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://ke.china-embassy.org/chn/xw/t1231223.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://ke.china-embassy.org/chn/xw/t1269370.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://ke.china-embassy.org/chn/xw/t1268975.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://ke.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201412/20141200820807.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27368877, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.eximbank.gov.cn/tm/medialist/index_26_27606.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.dazhongguo.org.cn/Info/enterURL/1/infoDetail.jsp?infoID=9700043, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2014-05/12/c_126488916.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/mombasa-nairobi-standard-gauge-railway-project/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.isk.or.ke/userfiles/SGR_Presentation_March_2015.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5652847de4b033f56d2bdc29/t/594d739f3e00bed37482d4fe/1498248096443/SGR+v4.pdf, Academic Journal Article",

32077,"China granted Cambodia an interest-free loan of 24 million USD to rebuild a 200 km long road from Kratie province to Trapeang Kriel, Stung Treng which is at the Cambodia-Laos border ( last segment of National Road No.7). The loan agreement was signed between Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Ning Fukui and the Cambodian government on November 27, 2003 in Phnom Penh. The interest-free loan agreement was one of two agreements signed during the ceremony; under the other agreement, China would provide a grant of US$6.1 million dollar to Cambodia, which would then be handed over to the Cambodian Foreign Ministry for general use by the Cambodian government (See Project ID#32081). 
The rebuilding project was undertaken by Shanghai Construction Group General Co. The project began on October 2004 and was completed on 31 Dec 2007. An Inauguration for the opening of the road was held on April 29, 2008. 
The interest-free loan is not the only recorded financial assistance provided by the Chinese government the project. In November 2002, China had provided a concessional loan with a 2% interest rate of US$60,980,000. On the same date, China had also provided US$2,430,000 in grant for the project (based on the 2 CDC reports found in the resource section below). The CDC reports are supported by a speech made by Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen, during his visit to the construction sites of National Road 7 in 26 July 2006; the PM has mentioned three types of assistance by China for the project- grant, non-interest loan and low-interest loan. It is difficult to tell if the US$24 million interest-free loan was provided by the Chinese government in addition to the US$60.98 million loan and US$2.43 million grant, or if the Chinese government has converted US$24 million out of the US$60.98 concessional loan into an interest-free loan. However, the 2009 'Overview on Transport Infrastructure Sectors in the Kingdom of Cambodia' report published by the Infrastructure and Regional Integration Technical Working Group (IRITWG) has recorded that the total cost of the rehabilitation project for National Road 7 is around US$62.8 million dollars and was financed by China, so the latter scenario is more likely.","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020031127dzbr001bj&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020031127dzbr000jj&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.mpwt.gov.kh/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2009-Overview-on-Transport-Infrastructure-Sectors-in-Kingdom-of-Cambodia.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://cnv.org.kh/selected-comments-in-the-visit-to-the-construction-sites-of-national-road-7-and-se-kong-bridge-in-the-province-of-stoeung-treng/, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://cdc.khmer.biz/reports/Individual_project_summary_report2008.asp?Record_Id=China-2006-SVIM881&DonorName=China, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://cdc.khmer.biz/reports/Individual_project_summary_report2008.asp?Record_Id=China-2006-SVIM872&DonorName=China, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.academia.edu/6898359/Cambodia-China_Relations_Based_on_the_Mutually_Beneficial_Interests_China_the_Most_Trusted_Friend_beyond_Doubt, Academic Journal Article; http://www.cdri.org.kh/webdata/download/wp/wp52e.pdf, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); http://kh.china-embassy.org/chn/zgjx/t450610.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.shsz.org.cn/book/shownews.asp?num=szzz-2006929154356, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020031127dzbr001bj&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020031127dzbr000jj&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks"

32176,"On 21 December 2009, the Cambodia Secretary of State and Minister of Economy and Finance, H.E. On Poan Monirath and the Chairman of EXIM Bank of China, Mr Li Ruogu, signed a Preferential Buyer's Credit Loan Agreement. Under the agreement, EXIM bank agrees to provide a concessional loan of US$31,014,469 for an irrigation project in Kampong Trabek, Prey Veng Province. The loan agreement for the project is one out of 14 agreements signed between China and Cambodia on 21 December 2009; the total value of the agreements was widely believed to be US$853 million (See Project ID#32201). While the development of an irrigation system is one of the objective, the project is more known to be a flood control project in response to Kampong Trabek being susceptible to flood damage. Based on a report by Mekong River Commission (MRC), the flood risk has been estimated at US$0.7 million per year. The goal of the project is to improve flood control standard and to upgrade land utilization rate, cultivation condition and grain output and to build flood control dyke on both banks of Preaek Tra Beak river together with field irrigation and drainage system so as to provide irrigation water source and ensure drainage capability. Based on the CDC report, the project will include the building of flood control dyke on both banks of Preaek Trabek river (aka Kampong Trabek River or Stung Trabek) together with an irrigation canal and drainage canal network so as to provide irrigation water source for crops and ensure drainage capability to prevent flood damage. This corroborates with the MRC report, which has mentioned similar flood control mechanism with much more details and has reported that once the proposed flood control mechanism have been installed, the villagers can expect about 5 crops per year and net benefits from paddy of US$3.45 million/year According to Mekong Institute, the project was completed on March 24, 2014. The project was handed over to Cambodia in April 2015. The loan details are unknown.

32249,"On 2 November 2011, the ground breaking ceremony for the construction of the 5th Cambodia-China Friendship Bridge called 2nd Chroy Changvar Bridge/ New Chroy Changvar Bridge was held. The 719-meter bridge is located in Phnom Penh's Russei Keo district, connecting the capital Phnom Penh in the west of the Tonle Sap river to National Road No. 6 in the east of the river. The road width is 14-m, with 8cm asphalt concrete pavement. The aim of the project is to address traffic congestion in/out of Phnom Penh; previously there was only one bridge, the Cambodia-Japan Friendship Bridge, to manage the route in/out of the city from three different directions. Based on the CDC report (found in the resource section below), EXIM Bank of China had provided a concessional loan of US$26,752,000 (though other reports suggest that the loan amount is US$27.5 million). The grace period is 7 years. The loan was 2% for 13 years. The construction was carried out by China Road and Bridge Corporation while Guangzhou Wanan Construction Supervision Co, Ltd. provided technical consultation and inspection. Based on the CDC report, the project will be completed in June 2015, though there have been no sources confirming the bridge's opening as of July 2015. The bridge was temporarily opened for traffic twice; the first was during Pchum Ben in September 2014 and the second was during the Water Festival period.

33244,"As part of bilateral trade and cultural agreements, the Chinese government has announced that it would provide a preferential buyer's credit worth US$300 million to Sri Lanka. The announcement was made during Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's visit to Sri Lanka in April 2005. On 1 July 2005, Sri Lankan high ranking official delegation headed by Dr.P.B Jayasundara, Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Planning, and Chinese government officials had three day discussions regarding how to use the US$300 million in credit facilities. After discussion, the US$300 million would be used to finance the First Stage of Norochcholai Coal Power Plant. In 2006 the Sri Lankan Government signed a contract for loans with the Export-Import Bank of China to construct the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant located in Puttalam (See Project ID#33276 for more details on how the agreement come about). This was done in order to meet rising demand for electricity in Sri Lanka. This plant was to be implemented by China Machinery Engineering Corporation under the supervision of the Ceylon Electricity Board and was to be completed in three phases of 300 megawatt capacity for a total of 900 megawatt productivity. The first phase involved a loan of 300 million USD as 'preferential buyers credit' with an interest rate of 2% and a 150 million USD loan as 'buyers credit' with an interest rate of 6% (See Project ID#33463). This loan is a 20 year soft loan with a 5 year grace period and 2% interest. The Government of Sri Lanka contributed 5300 million LKR to this phase of the project. Construction of the first phase began in 2007 and is now complete. The second and third phase of 600 megawatts involved another loan from Sri Lanka in 2009 worth 891 million USD. The Sri Lankan Government contributed 11,000 Million LKR for this phase of the project. Currently, the second phase is complete and the third phase is being implemented. This plant is sometimes referred to as the Lakvijaya Power Plant. China merchants group owns an 85% stake in this power plant as of 2012.

34399,"In 2012, China signed an agreement with Nepal to build a dry port in Nepal's Larcha, near Tatopani customs on the northern border with China, and will cost an estimated Rs 1.2 billion (13.8 million USD, 86.2 million RMB) and funded with Chinese grant. 27.5 million square feet of land has been allocated near Tatopani for the port, parking for up to 200 trucks, agricultural quarantine, inspection house, warehouses, and a customs office. The government of Nepal has assigned the Inter-modal Transport Development Board to facilitate all the construction work which will be done by China_„Žs Beijing Real Estate Group Company. Under the project, a border inspection building, cargo warehouse, litigation-warehouse, a parking lot with a capacity of accommodating at least 158 big containers and 33 cars and a 112-meter-long bridge over the Bhotekoshi River will be constructed. China had also agreed to upgrade a 6.5 km road connecting the dry port to the border with China. Construction began in December 2012 and was expected to be completed within 2 and a half years. The construction project is expected to ease the bottleneck for surging trade between China and Nepal. As of November 2014, the completion of the dry port will be delayed as a result of transportation problems created by a landslide in Jure, Sindhupalchok, and the sweeping away of the Bhotekoshi bridge by floods. The bridge was crucial to transporting construction materials to the dry port. The government has also failed to clear houses along the road connecting Miteri Bridge and the dry port. The road expansion and construction of a bridge over Bhotekoshi are included in the dry port contract. At this point only 60-65 percent of the construction work has been completed. Technical experts at the project say at the current pace of work, it will take another one year from the deadline to complete the project.","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=PRTRIN0020090113e51c0004e&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2012/12/20/money/larcha-dry-port-construction-begins/243137.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=72732, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://en.people.cn/90883/8066638.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.ekantipur.com/2014/11/20/business/larcha-dry-port-completion-to-be-delayed-by-one-year/397942.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://np.chineseembassy.org/eng/News/t946364.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.nepalmountainnews.com/cms/2012/12/12/dry-port-construction-to-begin-at-nepal-china-border/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=88563, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.tibetanreview.net/china-to-build-dry-port-for-nepal-near-tibet-border/, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=PRTRIN0020090113e51c0004e&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks"

China Exim Bank provided the preferential export buyer's credit worth 160 million USD for the construction of the bridge.

In October 2003, the contract for the Labuhan Angin power plant project was signed between state-owned electricity company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) and a Chinese contractor CMEC (China National Machinery & Equipment Import & Export Group Corp). 85% of the construction funds was provided by a preferential export buyer's credit by the Chinese government to Indonesia. The contract worth US$ 232 million came into effect in March 2005. The two-unit, 230-MW Labuhan Angin power station began commercial operations in 2008 and was successfully handed over in April 2009. An additional 115 MW power station is currently in the planning stage. The loan is part of an earlier loan agreement with China worth US$400 million. In December 2002, China extended a US$400 million preferential loan to Indonesia following Chinese President Jiang Zemin's pledge in March 2002. The loan, to finance infrastructure programs in Indonesia, is to be repaid in 15 years with a 7 year grace period and 3 percent interest rate. Indonesia plans to use the loan for infrastructure projects including the building of a power plant in Sumatra by the state-owned power company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (project #34922) and a railway track construction project in Java by the state-owned railway company PT Kereta Api Indonesia. In May 2004 Indonesia used US$70 million of the loan to continue construction of a 160 kilometer double track linking Cirebon in West Java to Kroya in Central Java. It also appears that Indonesia used US$160 million of the loan for the construction of Suramadu bridge (project #34757). China would subsequently add an additional loan of US$200 million for the Parit Baru power plant (#35240) and double-track railway in Java (#38862). Staff Note: Conflicting accounts on loan amount.

35266,"The Neelum-Jhelum hydropower, commenced in January 2008, was to be cofinanced by a number of Middle Eastern and Chinese financiers. According to Pakistan Ministry of Water and Power, as of August 30, 2013, details were being worked out for arranging loan of 448 million USD with China Export-Import Bank. The total cost of the 960-MW project is 87 billion rupees. Neelum Jhelum Hydroelectric Project (NJHEP) is located in the vicinity Muzaffarabad (AJ&K). It envisages the diversion of Neelum river water through a tunnel out -falling into Jhelum River. The intake Neelum Jhelum is at Nauseri 41 Km East of Muzaffarabad. The Powerhouse will be constructed at Chatter Kalas, 22 Km South of Muzaffarabad. After passing through the turbines the water will be released into Jhelum River about 4 Km South of Chatter Kalas. Neelum Jhelum Hydroelectric Project has installed capacity of 969 MW. The Project will produce 5.15 Billion units of electricity annually. 

The project was considerably delayed and its cost increased. In June 2015 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif decided to form a committee to deliberate over the privitisation of Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project or seek investment in it. On 2 July 2015 the financiers from the Middle East have halted loan of 433 million USD after huge increase in cost of the project to 4.21 billion USD. On July 3 the China Three Gorges Corporation expressed its interest in a financing consortium to fund up to 50 billion USD of hydroelectric power projects in Pakistan, which could include the Neelum-Jhelum project. The Neelum-Jhelum project will be constructed at a site about 20 km from Muzaffarabad in Azad Kashmir. 

In January 2014, China EXIM Bank delivered the first 17 million USD out of the committed 448 million.

35615,"In 2007, following the disastrous earthquake in Kashmir, China committed to fund a seismic network for Pakistan. Wang Chao, Assistant Minister for Commerce, People's Republic of China and Akram Malik signed the Letter of Exchange on behalf of their respective governments on Wednesday 18 July 2007. The signing ceremony was witnessed by Dr Salman Shah, the Prime Minister's financial adviser. Under the agreement, the Chinese government would establish Digital Seismic Network in Pakistan, which will include design of the project, survey and selection of the stations, provision of earthquake monitoring equipment and its transportation to Islamabad, dispatch of technical personnel to Pakistan for equipment installation and commissioning of technical service and training of Pakistani technical personnel. The project assistance will be in form of a grant. Concrete matters regarding implementation of this project would be stipulated in a separate contract to be signed between the agencies to be designated by the two governments. Previously China had already agreed to provide a grant of approximately 10 m dollar in April 2007 for the Pakistan-China Centre and Digital Seismic Network in Pakistan. A 2013 resource states that the project to install new broadband seismic stations equipped with advance technology that was initiated following the 2005 Kashmir Earthquake to strengthen seismic monitoring system, has completed. Pakistan Meteorology Department (PMD) would officially inaugurate these stations on May 16, 2013 in Islamabad. STAFF_NOTE: this project seems different from the Pakistan-China Centre and also from the PakistanäóñChina Seismograph Network (PCSN) (but it is not clear whether these two are the same). The project of strenghtening the seismic monitoring system which has been completed in 2013 seems to be the project in question. A 2014 resource instead states that The PakistanäóñChina Seismograph Network (PCSN), a joint venture of Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and China Earthquake Network Center (CENC), is likely to start functioning by the end of the current fiscal year. Note that the flow class is different: grant vs JV. In sum, it is not very clear which is what. There are at least 2 project on seismographic matters, one completed in 2013 and one to be completed in 2014. After order has been done, it will be necessary open new projects (at least one, since the 2014 one is not coded) and redistribute the resources which have been added here. Also, in 2005 right after the quake, China promised some seismological instruments, it could be the one or more of the mentioned projects are the actual implementation of that pledge.

35662,"The total cost of the construction for the new Council of Ministers building was estimated to be 225.07 million RMB, which was financed by China in terms of concessional loans (as quoted by the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) Summary Report). Concessional loans was received by Cambodia in two separate events: On July 2005, Cambodia Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen signed five agreements guaranteeing funds during the second summit of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Under the agreements, China agreed to provide concessional loan of US$30 million to the Cambodian government to build a new Council of Ministers building. In 2007, Prime Minister Hun Sen witnessed the signing of a '50 million yuan (about US$7 million) with low-interest loan for the additional construction of the Council of Ministers Office' during his participation in the Fourth China-ASEAN International Exhibition. The building with the total space of 32, 580 square meters can be loaded up to 200 people in big Conference Hall and many other smaller rooms, and all are being used by many government's institutions under the Office of the Council of Ministers. The building has been used since February 2009, but it has not been officially inaugurated until 19 October 2010. While the construction of the building was initially reported to be funded by China's concessional loan, it was reported later that China has donated the office building as part of China's gift from the Chinese government to honour 50 years of diplomatic relations between Beijing and Phnom Penh (reported in article published by Xinhua News Agency, 12 August 2008). The 'Keynote Address at the Official Inauguration of the Office of the Council of Ministers' by Prime Minister Hun Sen further suggests that the office building was donated to the Cambodia government- Hun Sen conveyed his deep gratitude 'to the people and government of the People_„Žs Republic of China for the valuable grant to build [the] buildings that will be used to improve efficiency and delivery of public services for Cambodian people.'","http://cdc.khmer.biz/reports/Individual_project_summary_report2008.asp?Record_Id=China-2006-SVIM858&DonorName=China, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-10/19/c_13564809_2.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/hun-sen-secures-400-million-china, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020071029e3at002gx&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://primeministerhunsen.blogspot.sg/2010/10/keynote-address-at-official_24.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/council-ministers-building-delayed, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=XNHA000020050117e117000io&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Download/Brc/pdf/03_chapter1.pdf, Academic Journal Article; http://kh.china-embassy.org/chn/zgjx/t406015.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020071029e3at002gx&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=XNHA000020050117e117000io&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks"

Significant environmental controversy means poor transparency on project details. Drilling began in Tiputini around May 2015 and production began around April 2016. The drill is operational. In October 2014, three platforms and 90 wells were planned to be built. Around 200 are needed in order to extract 920m barrels of crude thought to be located in the block. At Ishpingo, PetroAmazonas plans to install 5 platforms and drilling of 10 wells starting 2017.","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=EFESE00020070326e33q000eb&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/du/article.aspx/?accessionno=NFINCE0020070411e34b0005l&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=&cat=a, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=LATIND0020070326e33q002s3&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=TOILDA0020070403e33r00008&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=PON0000020130927e98u0000e&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2014/feb/19/china-development-bank-credit-proposal-oil-drilling-ecuador1, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.argusmedia.com/pages/NewsBody.aspx?id=931445&menu=yes, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/19/ecuador-oil-china-yasuni, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/opinion/ecuador-breaks-its-amazon-deal.html?ref=opinion&_r=1&utm_source=GEGI+Round+Up+11&utm_campaign=GEGI+Round+Up+11&utm_medium=email, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=EFESE00020070326e33q000eb&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/du/article.aspx/?accessionno=NFINCE0020070411e34b0005l&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=&cat=a, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=LATIND0020070326e33q002s3&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=TOILDA0020070403e33r00008&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=PON0000020130927e98u0000e&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks"

The satellite would carry out territorial surveys, including soil studies and natural resource explorations (e.g. water and minerals near the earth's surface). The second satellite project will be on a much smaller scale than the first one. The second satellite will be lighter, smaller, and at a much lower orbit-- so it will cost less.

The project and design of the airport expansion project is to be executed by China Harbour Engineering Company. The project includes a 3.3km extension of the airport runaway to take 747 sized aircraft, the building of a new construction terminal, and acquiring new equipment such as additional boarding bridges and new information, security, and monitoring systems. The existing 7,448ft long runway is being extended to 10,800ft to make it a category Code 4E runway and to enable it to accommodate the BOEING 747-400 aircraft. Excavation and backfilling works for the runway extension are currently in progress. The environmental impact assessment for the project has already been conducted. Guyana's main airport is the Cheddi Jagan International Airport at Timehri, 40 km from the capital, Georgetown, and the Ogle Municipal Aerodrome on the East Coast of Demerara. Construction on the terminal and runway was expected to begin by March 2013 and be completed 32 months later. In 2013, Already, the Government had advanced CHEC over US$20M ($4B) to start works.Actual construction had been stalled as the Opposition, during the National Budget considerations of the estimates in April, blocked $5.3B (US$26.5M) that was going to the project, citing concerns over the costs. Guyana could very well face paying CHEC for damages if the construction did not start soon. In 2015,the Guyana government signaled that it would be going ahead with the expansion of the Cheddi Jagan International Airport (CJIA), although much more funds were needed to complete the project to international standards. In 2015, December 31, in an update on the expansion works at the Cheddi Jagan International Airport, Public Infrastructure Minister David Patterson told Guyana Times that he only last week met with officials of the China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), and they briefly discussed the risk elements. Government, he reminded, was aiming for completion by the second quarter of 2017. Here are some of the features of that agreement: 1. Currency: The loan is in the Chinese currency the renminbi, and all the exchange risks are to be borne by Guyana. If the renminbi appreciates relative to the Guyana dollar, the cost of the loan goes up. 2. Interest: The rate of interest is 2% per annum but this is a disguise because a management fee of 0.75% is taken out upfront. 3. Taxes: No income or withholding taxes apply to any payment under the agreement, whether interest, management fee or commitment fee. 4. Use of proceeds: To be applied by the Government of Guyana for the sole purpose of payment of 94.2% of the contract with China Harbour. Much of the balance has to go to pay EXIM Bank a Management Fee of 0.75% and a Commitment Fee of 0.5% per annum.","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=BBCMAP0020121101e8b1000b5&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=CARU000020121204e8c10002q&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=WDAN000020121102e8b20001z&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=CARU000020130202e9210002d&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/cheddi-jagan-international-airport-expansion-guyana/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.cjairport-gy.com/?q=article/us59m-approved-cjia-modernisation-project, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121107/business/business81.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://tradebridgeconsultants.com/news/government/guyana-and-china-sign-agreement-to-expand-cheddi-jagan-airport/, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/2013/07/07/cjias-expansion-and-the-toilet-bowl-explanation/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://guyaneseonline.wordpress.com/2015/06/25/cjia-expansion-project-to-go-ahead/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.guyanatimesgy.com/2015/12/31/feasibility-study-for-guyanas-airline-still-ongoing-patterson/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.chrisram.net/?p=1250, Social Media, including Unofficial Blogs","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=BBCMAP0020121101e8b1000b5&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=CARU000020121204e8c10002q&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=WDAN000020121102e8b20001z&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=CARU000020130202e9210002d&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks"

37103,"On May 11, 2014, Kenyan and Chinese leaders formally signed agreements for the construction of a 3.8 billion USD portion of a railway to run from the Kenyan port of Mombasa to Nairobi and then on to neighboring states. It is to run from Mombasa to Nairobi and will extend eventually to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan. China was to finance 90% of the first stage which costs $3.8bn (‘£2.3bn), with Kenya putting up the remaining 10%. However, a working paper from China Africa Research Institute reported that China provided 85% of the total project financing with Kenya providing the remaining funds. China Exim Bank provided $1.6 billion concessional loan and a commercial loan of $1.633 billion for a total of $3.233 billion. The $1.6 billion concessional loan is good for 20 years at a 2% interest rate and a payment period of 13 years with a 7 year grace period (project #31777). The $1.633 billion preferential concessional loan has a 'interest rate of six months' (assumed typo in source), valid for 15 years with a payment period of 10 and grace period of 5.

This funding was for two projects: the Telecom Sports Arena in Rarotonga, and the Ministry of Education administration building in Nikao (see project #40532). The amount of this loan that would go toward the arena was $8.5 million USD while $1.1 mil was set aside for the Ministry of Education building (discrepancy, see note). The conditions of the loan include a 2% interest, 5 year grace period, and a 20 year maturity rate. The project was meant to assist the Cook Islands in hosting the 2009 South Pacific Mini Games. China negotiated the use of a Chinese contractor, China Civil Engineering construction Corporation, for the implementation of the arena. Construction on this project ran from 2008-2009 and the stadium is now complete. In 2014 the building required extensive repairs. STAFF_NOTE: There is some discrepancy in how much this project cost.

38053,"In order to accelerate the oil production in Venezuela, China Development Bank has agreed to provide $4 billion in loans to PDVSA. This new loan would have a maturity date of 8 years at a rate of LIBOR + 5 percent. The loan was intended to increase the rate of production from 330,000 barrels a day from 120,000 by 2014. The loan fuels an investment established on 17 April 2001 the joint-venture company Sinovensa, when CNPC and PDVSA reached an agreement to produce Orimulsion. The fuel is marketed as a replacement for coal or fuel oil in power plants. Most nations have decreased their consumption of the fuel, but China continues to invest and consume Orimulsion. CNPC holds 70 percent of equity in the project. This percent is slowing changing: in 2013, CNPC owned about 37.57% stake. However, the joint venture handles the fund directly, rather than being channeled through the state company or the government. On June 3rd, 2013, CNPC and PDVSA signed a 4.02 billion USD Financing agreement with China Development Bank. The money will be used for increasing the daily production of the joint-venture SINOVENSA from 140,000 barrels to 330,000 barrels. Sinovensa is a joint venture between CNPC and PDVSA. It is unclear if the daily production rate increased the expected amount. Additionally, two smaller credit lines of $1.5 billion (project ID #38055) and $500 million (project ID #38056) were provided for refinery operations and the purchase of oilfield equipment, respectively.

38546,"Bank of China signed the financing agreement with PLN, the national power company of Indonesia, on May 4, 2009 for the Banten Lontar power plant. The financing amount is 455 million USD. The loan has 13 years of maturity, which includes 3 years of grace period. The $808.4 million power plant in Lontar, Banten (known as Banten 3 or Banten Lontar), has a capacity of 945 MW (3 x 315 MW) and was built by a consortium that included Chinese power equipment giant Dongfang Electric Corp. and Indonesian Dalle Energy. 28 December 2012 marked the handing over ceremony of the structures and operations of power generators that has been completed, from China to Indonesia. The plant is currently still in operation. The project is part of the Fast Track Program, which is a plan by the Indonesian government to add power plants around the country, which total to about 10000 MW. The program covers the construction of 33 (some sources state 32, while others state 35) power plants, 10 of them in Java and Bali, with 23 located off the two main islands, said Rudiantara, PLN's vice president director. So far contracts for 32 power plants have been signed, and most of these have now reached the construction phase. However, the investors have suspended temporarily the release of further disbursements, asking for an increase in the interest rates for both the funds that have been cashed in, as well as the funds that are now frozen. Furthermore, disbursements are being suspended pending the outcome of another project. Merpati Airlines committed to loan money from China to purchase Chinese aircrafts. However, Merpati reneged on its loan due to financial difficulty. Since then, the governments had to step in to proceed with discussions. 

It seems like some disbursements have still been received at different points in time. PLN have managed to secure around 65 percent of the total financing needed. On the other hand, for several smaller power-plant projects outside of Java Island, PLN negotiated with the Association of Provincial Development Banks (Asbanda) to provide Rp 4.5 trillion in financing. China Development Bank pulled out of financing the 250-megawatt coal-fired power plant project in JENEPONTO (SOUTH SULAWESI) sponsored by PT Bosowa Corp, the largest diversified business group in eastern Indonesia. 

There has been little information on all the projects that have been cancelled or successfully funded after the suspensions in funding. However, some information on several projects is available and have individual project records with updated information.

The plant is 2x110 MW units, which should start up in early 2011. The loan has a 15-year maturity, with a three-year grace period. In August 2014, the 2x110MW power plants were completed and commercially operational.
The project is part of the Fast Track Program, which is a plan by the Indonesian government to add power plants around the country, which total to about 10000 MW. The program covers the construction of 33 (some sources state 32, while others state 35) power plants, 10 of them in Java and Bali, with 23 located off the two main islands, said Rudiantara, PLN's vice president director. So far contracts for 32 power plants have been signed, and most of these have now reached the construction phase. 
However, the investors have suspended temporarily the release of further disbursements, asking for an increase in the interest rates for both the funds that have been cashed in, as well as the funds that are now frozen. Furthermore, disbursements are being suspended pending the outcome of another project. Merpati Airlines committed to loan money from China to purchase Chinese aircrafts. However, Merpati reneged on its loan due to financial difficulty. Since then, the governments had to step in to proceed with discussions. 
It seems like some disbursements have still been received at different points in time. PLN have managed to secure around 65 percent of the total financing needed. On the other hand, for several smaller power-plant projects outside of Java Island, PLN negotiated with the Association of Provincial Development Banks (Asbanda) to provide Rp 4.5 trillion in financing. China Development Bank pulled out of financing the 250-megawatt coal-fired power plant project in Jeneponto (South Sulawesi) sponsored by PT Bosowa Corp, the largest diversified business group in eastern Indonesia.

38606,"The coal-fired Indramayu power plant, which has a maximum capacity of 3x330 megawatts (MW), was officially opened on Oct 12, 2011. The plant is built on a 83-hectare site in Sumur Adem village in Indramayu, West Java and is one of the power plants in the first phase of the government's 10,000 MW fast-track program. The construction of the Indramayu plant began in 2007, and was contracted to a consortium consisting of the China National Machinery Industry Corporation, the China National Electric Equipment Corporation and PT Penta Adi Samudera as the contractor. The total investment required to set up the power plant reached US$696.73 million plus Rp 1.5 trillion. Of this, the US$592 million syndicated loan was arranged by a Bank of China-led consortium of banks for PLN Persero in May 2008. The deal carries a tenor of 13 years, with a three-year period of grace. Along with China Export-Import Bank, BNP Paribas, China Construction Bank, China Development Bank, ICBC, SociÍ©tÍ© GÍ©nÍ©rale and China Citic joined the list of mandated lead arrangers. Nine banks joined the senior lead arranger group: ANZ Bank, Bayerische Landesbank, Calyon, Credit Suisse, Fortis, ING, Natixis, RBS and WestLB. Lead arrangers were Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC). Sinosure (China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation) is insuring 95% of the loan, and the Indonesian ministry of finance is providing a full guarantee. Despite the fact that the facility was heavily oversubscribed, Indonesia chose to take only US$592 million, which is 85% of the total contract price. The remaining 15% of the total cost will be provided in local currency financing arrangements by Indonesian banks. The 1st and 2nd unit of the 3x330MW power plant started commercial operations in January and May 2011 respectively, while the 3rd unit passed the performance testing in September 2011.

41941,"On June 13, 2011, China Development Bank signed a memorandum to commit a $ 1.5 billion loan to Kazakh Copper Company (Originally called Kazykhmys PLC, now called KazMinerals) for copper mine development projects in Aktobe. Aktobe maintains a volume of 5 million tons of copper. The money was used to construct Aktogay mine. First copper cathode production from oxide ore occurred in December 2015, whilst first copper in concentrate output from sulphide ore is planned for 2017. The project capital cost is expected to be in the region of $2.3 billion. Kaakhstan will reportedly take care of the remaining needed funds itself. The mine is expected to produce up to 100,000 tons of copper concentrate annually in 2015. On February 16, 2012 the loan was finalized and signed as two transactions one for RMB 1 billion (158 million), the other for 1.34 billion USD. It is being developed as an open-pit mine including an on-site concentrator and construction work started in the first half of 2013. The Facility has a final maturity of 15 years from the date of first drawing. The total Aktogay Facility of approximately $1.5 billion is comprised of two separate agreements, a USD agreement for up to $1.34 billion and an RMB agreement for up to RMB 1.0 billion (approx $158 million). Both agreements are reportedly on essentially similar terms and conditions, except that proceeds drawn under the RMB agreement can only be applied towards payments to Chinese suppliers for equipment, materials and services sourced from China. The interest rate on the USD agreement is set with reference to USD LIBOR, while the RMB agreement is at the applicable benchmark rate published by the People's Bank of China (PBoC).","http://kz.mofcom.gov.cn/article/zxhz/tzwl/201106/20110607607532.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://news.sina.com.cn/w/2011-06-14/073122636248.shtml, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/hkstock/ggIPO/20110613/17019982894.shtml, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.kazminerals.com/en/operations/aktogay, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.kazminerals.com/resources/1235/CDB%20Dec%202011%20Final%20v2%20161211.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.caifcgroup.com/press/1/59.jsp, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZWIR0020111221e7ck000dy&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/mining/8573834/Kazakhmys-gets-1.5bn-loan-from-China.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.mining-technology.com/projects/aktogay-copper-mine/, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZWIR0020111221e7ck000dy&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks"

42559,"China agreed to finance $3 billion of agricultural projects in Ukraine in areas including trade, fertilizer and cultivation, said the Ministry of Agriculture. The Export-Import Bank of China will fund projects to be carried out by State Food & Grain Corp of Ukraine and China National Complete Plant Import & Export Corp, the ministry said. The main areas include procuring pesticide, seeds and equipment from China, selling Ukrainian agricultural products to China, the construction of pesticide and organic fertilizer plants, and growing crops, the ministry said. -------- On June 28 in Beijing a Memorandum of Cooperation between the Ministry of Agricultural Policy and Food of Ukraine and the Export-Import Bank of China has been signed to support priority projects in agriculture. The memorandum allows Ukraine to obtain funds in the amount of $ 3 billion to fund specific projects in the agricultural sector. 'China has shown flexibility on this issue and we thank it for this, we will not fail and will supply to China agricultural products of high quality', - he said. ------- So far, they have reached agreements on the credit terms and conditions and the interest rate, while concrete projects and conditions of receiving the money will be discussed separately. As Ukrainian News earlier reported, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food Supplies in July 2011 announced readiness of the Eximbank of China to invest USD 10 billion in the Ukrainian agro-industrial sector. ----- The sides signed a memorandum which assumes that the loan with an interest rate of 6 percent will mature in 15 years, the regulator, based in capital Kiev, said in the statement. ------ Ukraine will supply 2.0 million to 2.5 million tonnes of maize to China every year to pay off a $3 billion loan, Ukrainian Farm Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk was quoted as saying on Friday. ----- The State Food Grain Corporation of Ukraine (SFGCU) has received the first $1.5-billion tranche of a loan from China's Eximbank, Ukrainian Agrarian Policy and Food Minister Mykola Prisyazhniuk told reporters. 'We have received $1.5 billion for forward procurements in line with the credit agreement that the SFGCU signed with the Chinese Eximbank,' Prisyazhniuk said.The Ukrainian parliament has allowed the SFGCU to borrow $3 billion under state guarantee from the Chinese Eximbank. The funds will go towards agriculture projects. The SFGCU will buy barley, wheat and corn. The proceeds will raise additional funds for this year's spring sowing campaign. The Ukrainian Finance Ministry has said the Chinese bank is prepared to lend the money at six-month LIBOR+4.5% over 15 years with a five-year grace. The money will go towards the construction of a herbicide factory, to process organic fertilizers, land cultivation, irrigation systems and to buy plant-protection chemicals, farm machinery and other equipment. --------- The first $1.5 Bl tranche of the loan from the Export-Import Bank of China has been used by Ukraine in line with the agreement with this country, Agrarian Policy and Food Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk told journalists. _„ñWe received $1.5 Bl. All the money has been used for supporting the agricultural sector. We spent UAH 8 Bl on forward grain purchases and UAH 4 Bl on corn supplies. These are our obligations under the agreement,_„ Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said. -------- China is seeking compensation of US$3 billion from Ukraine for the breach of a loans-for-grain contract signed in 2012, Russian media reported yesterday. So far, Chinese importers have only received US$153 million worth of Ukrainian grain, or 180,000 tonnes, the report said. The loan contract stipulated the supply of Ukrainian grain over 15 years. The annual volume of grain exports would vary but would not exceed six million tonnes a year. -------- China National Complete Engineering Corporation (CCEC) and the State Food and Grain Corporation of Ukraine (SFGCU) have agreed to set up a working group to perform a comprehensive audit of SFGCU's implementation of a Chinese contract during the period of April 3-10, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food said.","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=BDU0000020120530e85u00015&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=UKGOV00020120702e8720008d&cat=a&ep=ASE, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=UKRNEW0020120702e87200461&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=BDU0000020120703e8730001h&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=LBA0000020120706e876000et&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=DAIBN00020130207e926001bg&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=UKAGRO0020130227e92s0000n&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=SCMCOM0020140227ea2r0000e&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=UKRNEW0020140402ea42004xt&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=GORPOE0020131009e9a70000r&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=GORPOE0020131218e9cg0000n&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://gorshenin.eu/media/uploads/078/06/ffc0dbed8e81.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient)","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=BDU0000020120530e85u00015&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=UKGOV00020120702e8720008d&cat=a&ep=ASE, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=UKRNEW0020120702e87200461&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=BDU0000020120703e8730001h&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=LBA0000020120706e876000et&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=DAIBN00020130207e926001bg&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=UKAGRO0020130227e92s0000n&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=SCMCOM0020140227ea2r0000e&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=UKRNEW0020140402ea42004xt&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=GORPOE0020131009e9a70000r&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=GORPOE0020131218e9cg0000n&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks"

47016,"The Sri Lankan government recently signed an agreement with the EXIM Bank of China for the purchase of six MA-60 aircraft at a cost of $105.4 million. They will be used for passenger transportation between domestic & regional destinations. The loan maturity is 20 years including a 5-year grace period. In 2015, questions were raised about the economic projections used to justify the loan that was taken out for the planes and the safety standards of the planes in question. STAFF_NOTE: Some sources list Sri Lanka as getting a loan for 2 aircrafts, while some sources say the $105.4 million is for 6 planes but that they had two already. Another source says that the first two MA-60 planes were only $18 million USD. The first two were purchased in 2009, and the other 4 were maybe purchased in 2012, based on the sources found. STAFF_NOTE: According to one article, the Sri Lankan company that received the aircraft loans violated the ExIm Bank's terms and that the planes were given to the military. See following article excerpt: The latest investigation into corruption at SriLankan Airlines has expanded beyond the $2.3 billion Airbus deal and extended to the purchase of two passenger planes from China violating all norms of civilian safety rules. The Weliamuna investigation into SriLankan Airlines found not only corruption, but institutional cover up, criminal negligence and gross neglect of safety in allowing Chinese planes to operate without safety clearance. Defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapakse had initiated the purchase of six MA-60 aircraft in 2008, but the proposal was surreptitiously made through the civil aviation ministry to dodge financing conditions of ExIm bank of China. Gotabhaya wanted to acquire the aircraft for the Air Force, but the ExIm Bank could not finance a military purchase hence an elaborate deception was made to look like the aircraft were needed for Mihin Lanka. Colombo Mirror_„_can reveal that investigators have found hurriedly prepared feasibility studies justifying the purchase of MA-60 aircraft which did not meet even the Sri Lankan safety standards. Sri Lankan airlines Chief Executive Officer, Kapila Chandrasena, who resigned last month when the Weliamuna interim report called for his sacking and prosecution for corruption and criminal mismanagement of the airline, was CEO of Mihin Lanka when the initial deal was discussed. Chandrasena told investigators that the MA 60 'aircraft were for the air force and not for Mihin Lanka and acquisition arrangements were made entirely by the Ministry of Ports and Aviation' with help from the air force. 'The purported recording of this acquisition under Mihin Lanka in the budget estimates of the Ministry was merely to align the purchase with the conditionality relevant to the foreign funding (from ExIm Bank of China) arranged, which facility does not allow financing of supplies for the armed services.' Mihin Lanka and the Aviation minister who was working at the behest of a powerful personality had not only violated Sri Lankan laws, but also tried to deceive the Chinese bank and international aviation regulators. Kapila Chandrasena went as far as to put down in writing in November 2009 that the MA 60 planes were to operate to regional routes to India and the Maldives although neither destination allowed this type of aircraft into their airports. The MA60 aircraft cannot be operated by any civilian company in Sri Lanka either. This is when Gotabhaya Rajapaksa by way of a directive to the secretary and chief accountant of the Civil Aviation ministry to transfer the two aircraft to the Sri Lanka Air Force in December 2011, two months after the Air Force actually took delivery of the planes and proudly announced that 'these aircraft will be put to good use in meeting the ever growing need for air travel in the region.' The air force took delivery of the planes in September 2011.","https://defence.pk/pdf/threads/china-gains-edge-in-sri-lanka.192793/, Social Media, including Unofficial Blogs; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020050830e18u002p9&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.sundaytimes.lk/091206/News/nws_02.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://capsindia.org/files/documents/ISSUE-BRIEF_54_CHINA-CROWDING-INDIAN-INFLUENCE-OUT-OF-SRILANKA_13-July-2012.pdf, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page=article-details&code_title=123055, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.economynext.com/Sri_Lanka___Exim_Bank_of_China,_CATIC_aircraft_deal_murky;_mired_in_false_feasibility__probe_report-3-1521-.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020050830e18u002p9&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks"
